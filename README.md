# StringSearchKit

A simple library for macOS/iOS/tvOS - enabling fast, in memory, prefix based, string searching, using a Trie.

## Requirements
   - macOS 10.11+
   - iOS 9+
   - tvOS 9+
   
## Installation

StringSearchKit is available through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/?q=stringsearchkit). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod "StringSearchKit"
```


### Why is this framework useful?

Because it makes it really easy to implement **Auto-Complete** functionality in an application - as I did in my macOSâ„¢ app - [Sequence Diagram](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/sequence-diagram/id1195426709?mt=12) 

### How do I get started?

#### Usage:

   - `StringDictionary(withStrings: [String], preserveCase: Bool = false)`
   - `StringDictionary(withTextFileNamed: <A name of a text file in your Bundle>, preserveCase: Bool = false)`
   - `StringDictionary(withTextFilepath: <The path to a text file>), preserveCase: Bool = false`
   
Using one of the initialisers above, create an instance of `StringDictionary`.

When initialising from a file, it should simply contain one string per-line.

Strings are not limited to being single words - but are in the examples, for simplicity.

Example file contents :-
```
act
apologise
apology
app
apple
```

Once instantiated, use the `StringDictionary` to quickly find strings (case-insensitively) with a given prefix.

```
let stringDictionary = StringDictionary(withStrings: ["act", "app", "apple", "apologise", "apology"])
let searchResults = stringDictionary.strings(withPrefix: "app")

// searchResults will then contain ["app", "apple"]
```

### Search Result Case Preservation

If you set `preserveCase: true` in any of the `init` methods (default is `false` for backwards compatibility), the results will be returned in the same case that the original words were in when added.


For example:

```
let stringDictionary = StringDictionary(withStrings: ["Act", "App", "Apple", "Apologise", "Apology"], preserveCase: true)
let searchResults = stringDictionary.strings(withPrefix: "app")

// searchResults will then contain ["App", "Apple"]
```
